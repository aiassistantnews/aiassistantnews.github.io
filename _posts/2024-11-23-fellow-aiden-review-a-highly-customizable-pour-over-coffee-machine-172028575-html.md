# The Aiden: Revolutionizing Coffee Brewing 

In the world of coffee, the journey to the perfect cup often feels like an art form. For those who appreciate the intricate flavors and aromas that only a meticulous brew can provide, the Aiden by Fellow has arrived as a game-changer. This automatic drip machine merges the precision of manual pour-over with the convenience of automation, allowing coffee lovers to craft their ideal brew without compromise. Let’s delve into how this innovation reshapes the coffee experience.

When I think about my ideal cup of coffee, pour-over stands out. It's an experience that demands patience and care, transforming each brew into a unique masterpiece. The local roasts I source weekly deserve that respect, and with the pour-over method, I can extract every nuanced flavor. While many countertop machines have attempted to replicate this experience, they often fall short—until now.

Enter the Fellow Aiden ($365). This automatic brewer doesn’t just claim to achieve pour-over quality; it actually delivers. With the capability to maintain precise water temperatures and a bloom cycle designed to kickstart the extraction process, the Aiden stands apart. It caters to everyone—from the novice to the seasoned coffee aficionado—with both guided brewing and extensive customization options. This level of control is what makes the Aiden an enticing alternative to traditional pour-over methods.

The Aiden redefines what an automatic coffee maker can be. Fellow is already celebrated for their beautifully designed coffee gear, but with the Aiden, they took a bold step towards minimalism. Its modern cube shape sets it apart from the cluttered aesthetics of typical drip machines. While it may not resonate with everyone, it presents a refreshing take on coffee technology.

On the left side, a removable water tank with clear volume markings simplifies the process of brewing your desired amount of coffee. You can easily fill it from a faucet without detaching it, which adds to the convenience. The brewing chamber features a spray head adjustment for single-cup brewing, complemented by a second brew basket that allows you to pour directly into your favorite cup.

The double-walled carafe below ensures that your coffee stays warm for hours. Although the lid doesn’t completely seal, it retains enough heat to keep your coffee at a drinkable temperature for a few hours. While I would have appreciated a secondary lid for optimal heat retention, the design ensures smooth pouring without mess—something my previous Moccamaster model cannot claim.

Instead of a mere on/off switch, the Aiden features a sleek, knob-driven interface that makes navigating its extensive menu intuitive. A small display sits at the top left, allowing you to easily select your desired options with a simple push of the knob. Admittedly, my review unit arrived with a damaged display, but the machine's performance was unaffected.

The coffee maker landscape is saturated with machines boasting pour-over quality that often fail to deliver. My experience with the Moccamaster over the past four years showed me the limitations of other models—issues like uneven water distribution and inadequate heat retention plagued my brewing experience. The Aiden, however, addresses these common grievances head-on.

Fellow’s design features dual shower heads that ensure even saturation of coffee grounds, allowing for consistent blooming and brewing cycles. You can choose to brew a full 10-cup carafe or just one cup, all while maintaining the same quality—no need for cumbersome single-cup pod machines. But Fellow didn’t stop there; they recognized the need for customization, a crucial element for true coffee enthusiasts.

The Aiden allows you to tweak brew temperatures, coffee-to-water ratios, and even the pulsing behavior of the water during brewing. You can customize every aspect, from the number of pulses to the duration and temperature of each pour. This level of control is unparalleled and fundamentally shifts how you can approach your coffee brewing experience.

Brew profiles—akin to recipes—further enhance the Aiden's capabilities. It comes with three preset profiles for light, medium, and dark roasts, providing a solid foundation for experimentation. For those who frequent specific coffee roasters, like my favorite, Vignette Coffee Roasters, you can apply their brewing guidance with precision. Eventually, Fellow plans to enable roasters and cafes to share their profiles, allowing you to replicate the café experience at home.

Don’t worry if you’re not ready to dive deep into coffee snobbery just yet. The Aiden’s guided brewing feature simplifies the process for beginners while still offering advanced users the convenience of a no-fuss brew. I found this especially useful on lazy weekends when I wanted a quick cup without the fuss.

The Aiden’s heating system is another triumph, granting precise control over water temperature throughout the brewing cycle. Any coffee enthusiast knows that temperature is paramount for extraction. The Aiden’s setup ensures that the water reaches the precise temperature needed for optimal flavor, and even allows you to adjust the temperature mid-brew without interruption.
