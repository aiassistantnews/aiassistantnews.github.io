# Neuralink Advances into Canada: A New Frontier in Brain-Computer Interface Trials

In a groundbreaking move, Neuralink is set to launch its first clinical trials outside the United States, marking a significant milestone in the pursuit of brain-computer interface technology. With the green light from Health Canada, the trials will take place at Toronto Western Hospital, designated as the exclusive surgical site for these pioneering procedures. This development follows Neuralink's establishment of a Canadian patient registry earlier this year, which has now transitioned into actively recruiting potential participants.

### A New Era of Human-Computer Interaction

Under the CAN-PRIME study, Neuralink aims to embed its innovative implant directly into the brains of participants, enabling them to interpret their neural activity. This groundbreaking technology promises to empower individuals to control computers and smartphones solely through their thoughts—eliminating the need for wires or any physical movement. The objective of this study is twofold: to assess the safety of the implant and its surgical robot, and to gauge the initial functionality of the Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) for individuals with quadriplegia. The insights gained from these trials could pave the way for improved implant placement techniques and enhancements to the technology itself.

Earlier this year, Neuralink successfully implanted its device in its first human patient. While there were some challenges, including the retraction of the implant's threads from the brain, the patient has reported positive progress. Recently, he expressed his intention to push the boundaries of this technology by undertaking a 72-hour challenge to showcase its potential. Meanwhile, Neuralink has taken precautionary measures for its second patient, who remarkably began using computer-aided design (CAD) software just weeks after surgery in July.

Neuralink is currently focusing its recruitment efforts on individuals who have limited or no use of both hands due to cervical spinal cord injuries or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). This targeted approach aims to maximize the impact of its innovative technology on those who need it most.

### Join the Revolution

Neuralink's announcement on X underscores its commitment to advancing the field of neural technology. "We’re thrilled to share that Health Canada has approved the launch of our first clinical trial in Canada! Recruitment is now open. If you have quadriplegia due to ALS or spinal cord injury, you may qualify. Visit our Patient Registry to learn more and apply." 

This is more than just a trial; it's a leap into the future of human potential. Together, we can redefine what it means to interact with technology.
