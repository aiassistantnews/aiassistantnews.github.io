# Embracing Transparency in Creation: The New Guidelines on itch.io

In a bold move towards transparency and accountability, itch.io has implemented new regulations that require creators to disclose their use of generative AI in their projects. This initiative signifies a shift in the landscape of independent digital creation, emphasizing the importance of honesty in the creative process. Let’s break down the essentials of this new policy.

Itch.io, the vibrant marketplace for independent digital creators, has introduced a crucial guideline that mandates creators to be transparent about their use of generative AI tools, such as ChatGPT and Midjourney. When uploading their projects, creators will encounter an AI generation disclosure box that compels them to confirm if their work incorporates AI-generated content. Should they acknowledge the involvement of generative AI, they must specify the types of content produced—with options including graphics, sounds, text and dialogue, or code.

For those maintaining a public asset page, the process is streamlined. A dialog box will appear in their dashboard, allowing them to efficiently bulk-tag multiple projects. Creators can easily select several assets from their list and indicate whether these contain AI-generated content. Each asset will receive appropriate tagging—either "AI Generated" for those that utilized AI tools or "No AI" for those that did not. Furthermore, each category of content will have its own sub-tag, enhancing clarity for potential buyers.

It’s essential to highlight that itch.io insists on tagging any asset that has employed AI in any capacity, including those that have been hand-edited. Failure to comply will render the asset ineligible for indexing, making it invisible to potential buyers. While the specifics of how itch.io will enforce these guidelines remain somewhat ambiguous, the marketplace is clearly making strides towards maintaining a transparent ecosystem. 

While some may argue that this policy doesn’t go far enough for those advocating for a complete ban on AI-generated content, it undeniably provides a mechanism for buyers who wish to avoid AI assets to filter them out. This is a significant step in fostering an ethical marketplace where creativity thrives on authenticity and transparency. With these changes, we’re not just shaping a marketplace; we’re cultivating a culture of integrity in digital creation.
