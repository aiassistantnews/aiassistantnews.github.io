# The Great Microsoft Recall: Delayed But Not Defeated!

Hold onto your keyboards, folks! Microsoft has just thrown a curveball regarding the highly anticipated Recall AI feature for the upcoming Windows 11 Copilot+ PCs. Initially set to launch on June 18, this shiny new tool will be taking a little detour before it hits your screens. 

In a recent update on the Windows Blog, Microsoft spilled the beans: Recall is shifting from being a “preview experience broadly available for Copilot+ PCs” to a more exclusive sneak peek solely for the Windows Insider Program. Yep, that’s right! Only the lucky testers in the Insider Community will get to play with this feature for now. The rest of us will have to patiently wait until Microsoft gathers valuable feedback from its enthusiastic testers before the grand rollout to all Copilot+ PCs. 

Why the delay, you ask? Well, Microsoft is on a mission to ensure that the Recall experience meets its sky-high standards for quality and security. After all, who wants to launch a feature that could turn into a privacy and security fiasco? Since its debut announcement at a flashy event in May, Recall has faced a fair share of skepticism, and Microsoft is keen to smooth things over. 

So, what exactly is Recall? Imagine this: a magical assistant that helps you find everything you've ever looked at on your computer—web pages, images, documents, emails, presentations, you name it! It works by taking snapshots of your digital life every few seconds and storing them in a nifty “Recall timeline.” Sounds great, right?

However, Microsoft’s initial assurances about local data processing and security weren’t enough to quell the rising tide of privacy concerns. In response, the tech giant announced some significant changes earlier this month, including making Recall an opt-in feature. When you fire up your new Copilot+ PC, Windows will ask you if you want to enable this feature. And there’s more! Users will need to verify their identities using Windows Hello—think facial recognition or fingerprint scanning—before diving into the encrypted Recall timeline. 

But hold on a second! This isn’t foolproof. If someone knows your PIN, they can still sneak a peek at your Recall snapshots. Yikes!  

Despite these enhancements, Microsoft has decided to hit the brakes on Recall’s launch. Maybe they realized there’s always room for improvement, and a little extra caution never hurt anyone. As of now, there’s no specific date for Recall’s availability in the Windows Insider Program, but testers can expect access in the coming weeks. Keep your eyes peeled for a new blog post detailing how to snag the preview version when it arrives. Just a heads up, though: you’ll need a Copilot+ PC with advanced CPUs equipped with neural processing units (NPUs) to get in on the action. 

So, while we wait for Recall to make its grand entrance, let’s keep our fingers crossed that it’s worth the hype!
