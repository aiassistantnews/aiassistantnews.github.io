**DeepSeek v3 is making waves in the AI community with its innovative Mixture-of-Experts architecture and remarkable accuracy across multiple benchmarks. This model promises to reshape the landscape of open-source large language models, offering both performance and cost efficiency.**
# Introduction
DeepSeek v3 is a significant advancement in open-source large language models (LLMs), making headlines for its impressive performance and efficiency. This model leverages a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, integrating cutting-edge innovations to bridge the gap between open-source and closed-source models.

## Key Findings

### Architecture and Performance
- **MoE Architecture**: DeepSeek v3 employs a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture with 671 billion total parameters, of which 37 billion are activated per token. This architecture allows for efficient processing by selectively activating neural networks based on the task at hand.
- **Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA)**: The model uses MLA to extract key details from text multiple times, enhancing its accuracy.
- **Multi-Token Prediction (MTP)**: DeepSeek v3 incorporates MTP to generate several tokens at once, speeding up inference and improving training efficiency.

### Training and Deployment
- **Training Data**: The model was pre-trained on 14.8 trillion diverse and high-quality tokens, followed by Supervised Fine-Tuning and Reinforcement Learning stages to fully harness its capabilities.
- **FP8 Mixed Precision Framework**: DeepSeek v3 adopts FP8 precision for key computations, reducing memory and computational costs while ensuring numerical stability and training reliability.

### Benchmarks and Comparisons
- **Benchmark Scores**:
  - **MATH 500 Benchmark**: Achieves a score of 90.2%, highlighting its superior accuracy in mathematical tasks.
  - **MMLU Benchmark**: Scores 88.5, slightly behind Llama3.1 but outperforming Qwen2.5 and Claude-3.5 Sonnet.
  - **DROP Benchmark**: Scores 91.6, outperforming the same models, demonstrating strong reasoning capabilities.

### Cost Efficiency
- **Resource Requirements**: Running DeepSeek v3 requires substantial resources, such as 384GB RAM for a 600B model, and could cost around $10K for a basic setup.
- **Cost Comparison**: Outperforms Sonnet at 53x cheaper API rates, making it a cost-effective option for AI tasks.
