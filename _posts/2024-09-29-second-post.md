# The First Work by A.I. Robot to Sell at Auction Nets a Whopping $1 Million

The first work created by an A.I. robot to arrive at auction has sold for $1.08 million as part of Sotheby’s Digital Art Sale.

The painting of the British mathematician and early computer developer Alan Turing was painted by Ai-Da Robot, which has been branded the world’s first ultra-realistic robot artist by Aidan Meller, the British gallerist who spawned the idea in 2019.
