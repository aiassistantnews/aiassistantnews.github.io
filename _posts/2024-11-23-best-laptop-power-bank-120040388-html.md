In today's fast-paced world, staying connected is non-negotiable. Whether you're on a plane, a train, or in a bustling airport, having a reliable source of power for your laptop can make all the difference. Smaller battery packs work wonders for phones and tablets, but when it comes to laptops, you need something more substantial. In this guide, we've meticulously tested portable chargers with capacities between 20,000mAh and 27,000mAh, ensuring they meet TSA regulations for carry-on luggage. While these power banks come with a higher price tag and a bulkier size compared to standard battery packs, they offer essential features like wireless charging and AC outlets for added versatility. Let’s dive into the best laptop power banks for 2024.

## What to Seek in a Laptop Power Bank

When evaluating a laptop power bank, consider its capacity, port availability, charge time, and additional features. The ideal power bank should not only match your device's requirements but also enhance your mobile experience without compromise. 

## Testing Methodology for Portable Laptop Chargers

Our testing process involved charging various devices, including the iPhone 15, Galaxy S23 Ultra, iPad Air, and a 16-inch MacBook Pro. Each power bank was evaluated based on how long it took to charge these devices and the efficiency of the charge delivered.

## Laptop Power Bank FAQs

### Elevate Your Travel Experience with the Right Power Bank

Traveling can often feel like a logistical nightmare, especially when it comes to finding power sources. The **Lion Energy Eclipse Mag** stands out with a robust 27,000mAh capacity, capable of powering your laptop for days. Featuring three wireless charging pads, it minimizes cable clutter while enabling you to charge multiple devices simultaneously. However, be mindful of battery drain; charging too many devices at once may slow down your charge times. 

Weighing in at two pounds, it’s compact yet substantial. While it lacks a display for remaining charge, the indicator lights provide a surprisingly accurate estimate. Remember, the wireless charging pad is exclusive to Apple Watches, but the two USB-A ports and one USB-C port should suffice for most of your charging needs.

At a competitive price of $149, the Eclipse Mag is a solid investment compared to other 27,000mAh options. For those seeking an alternative, **Anker’s Prime 27,650mAh** battery offers additional features like a handy display and extra charging ports, albeit at a pricier $235.

### Baseus Blade: Compact Power on the Go

I was pleasantly surprised by the **Baseus Blade**, a sleek and compact power bank weighing just over a pound. It’s an ideal companion for those who value portability without sacrificing performance. With an impressive charge time and two USB-C and USB-A ports, the Blade is a workhorse that delivers a good charge despite its smaller 20,000mAh capacity. At $100, it offers excellent value, especially for those looking for a dependable charger that won’t weigh them down.

### Goal Zero Sherpa 100AC: Rugged Versatility for the Adventurer

For those who thrive in the great outdoors, the **Goal Zero Sherpa 100AC** is a premium choice at $300. Equipped with a wireless charging pad, multiple USB ports, and even an AC outlet, this power bank is designed for heavy-duty use. While its price is steep, the rugged design and flexibility to recharge from solar panels or a car’s 12V port make it an invaluable tool for outdoor professionals.

### Mophie Powerstation Pro AC: The Heavyweight Champion

Lastly, the **Mophie Powerstation Pro AC** is a robust option that borders on luxury. Weighing over two pounds and hitting the upper limits of TSA regulations, it offers an AC port along with USB-A and USB-C connections. While it’s great for powering various devices, keep in mind that using the AC port for your laptop charger may lead to energy loss. 

## The Key Takeaway

Choosing the right power bank is about understanding your needs. For laptops, aim for a capacity of 20,000mAh or higher to ensure sufficient power. Remember, power banks are not just about capacity; efficiency matters too. The reality is that a 25,000mAh power bank may only deliver about 60% efficiency to your laptop due to voltage differences and energy loss during conversion.

In a world where staying connected is paramount, the right laptop power bank is not just a luxury; it's a necessity. Whether you're a traveler, a remote worker, or an outdoor professional, investing in a high-quality power bank can enhance your productivity and keep you powered up wherever life takes you.
