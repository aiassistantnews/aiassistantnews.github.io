# Unlocking the Future: Microsoft’s Recall Feature

Today marks a significant milestone in the evolution of personal computing. Microsoft is rolling out its much-discussed Recall feature to users of Copilot+ PCs. For those enrolled in the Windows Insider program and equipped with eligible hardware, this is your chance to preview a revolutionary tool designed to function like a "photographic memory" for all your digital interactions. Recall captures snapshots of your activity, setting the stage for a new era of search capabilities on your computer.

At its core, Recall aims to enhance the way you search for files, apps, websites, and images. Thanks to the power of artificial intelligence, you can now describe the content you're looking for—and let Recall do the rest. Once you’re set up, accessing Recall is as straightforward as navigating to the All apps list on your Start menu. To ensure your data remains secure, you’ll need to enable Windows Hello, BitLocker, and Secure Boot before opting in to save those invaluable snapshots.

Using your PC will remain as intuitive as ever until you find yourself in need of a past interaction. Each time you access Recall, you’ll authenticate your identity using a fingerprint, facial recognition, or a PIN—further ensuring your privacy. Importantly, this feature is entirely optional, a thoughtful response from Microsoft following valid privacy concerns raised by critics.

You maintain full control over your snapshots. You can pause their capture at any time, delete unwanted snapshots, or instruct Recall to overlook specific websites or applications. Microsoft has assured users that your snapshots are yours alone; they will not access, share, or utilize them for training purposes.

In an exciting twist, Recall is now equipped to recognize sensitive information—such as PINs, credit card numbers, and passwords—ensuring that snapshots containing this data will not be captured or stored.

The Insider preview also introduces a feature called Click To Do, powered by Recall. This innovative tool allows you to perform actions on text and images in your snapshots simply by holding down the Windows key and clicking on the content. You'll find functionalities akin to those in the right-click menu, including copying text, saving and sharing images, web searching, and opening identified URLs— all enhanced through AI's remarkable capabilities. Additional AI-driven features for images like background blurring, Bing visual search, and object removal are also included.

Currently, Recall is available exclusively for Snapdragon-powered Copilot+ PCs, but Microsoft has plans to expand this offering to Intel and AMD systems in the near future.

If you’re eager to dive into the world of Recall today—and are prepared to navigate the occasional bug that comes with an in-development Windows build—first, register for the Windows Insider program. From there, head to Settings > Windows Update > Windows Insider Program and click “Get Started.”

Select your Insider Program account, choose the Dev Channel, and reboot your system. Once your Copilot+ PC is back online, navigate to Settings > Windows Update, check for updates, and install Build 26120.2415. Welcome to the future of computing; let’s explore together.
