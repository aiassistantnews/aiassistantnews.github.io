# The Future of Search: A Call to Restructure Google

In a significant move that could reshape the landscape of the internet, the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) has unveiled a detailed 23-page document advocating for the breakup of Google. Central to this proposal is the sale of its Chrome web browser and the imposition of restrictions on Android, reinforcing earlier reports that suggested such drastic measures were on the table. The DoJ argues that divesting Chrome would sever Google’s grip on this vital gateway to the internet, granting rival search engines the opportunity to thrive.

The regulator further contends that Google must cease its preferential treatment of its own search engine on Android devices. Should the company neglect to comply, the DoJ suggests it may need to sell off its mobile operating system entirely. In a bid to foster competition, the proposal also includes measures for Google to syndicate search results independently and to sell its click and query data, enabling rival search engines and emerging AI startups to gain a foothold.

In response, Google expressed its concerns through its Keyword blog. The company characterized the DoJ's "staggering proposal" as a threat to consumers and a potential detriment to the United States' standing in the tech world. Kent Walker, the president of Global Affairs and chief legal officer, argued that the DoJ’s interventionist approach would not only harm American users but also disrupt the array of Google products that millions find indispensable in their daily lives.

This saga traces back to 2020 when the DoJ and several states initiated a lawsuit, alleging that Google had paid billions to device manufacturers in exchange for default status for its search engine. Fast forward to August, when federal judge Amit Mehta labeled Google as a "monopolist," asserting that it leveraged its power to impose "supracompetitive prices for general search text ads." To put this in perspective, Google controlled approximately 90 percent of the search engine market last year, processing nearly 9 billion searches daily.

The DoJ's proposals stem from this ruling, yet the political landscape suggests that the forthcoming Trump administration could dramatically alter the department's direction. Google's response appears to directly address the incoming president, highlighting concerns over national security, the necessity of transparency with foreign entities, and the risks of "government micromanagement." Trump himself has weighed in, suggesting that breaking up Google might be too extreme, advocating instead for fairness without dismantling the company.

This situation remains in its infancy, with numerous court cases and appeals anticipated. However, if realized, these proposals could signify a monumental shift in the operations of Google, a behemoth with 182,500 employees. More importantly, such changes could fundamentally alter how the internet functions, given that over 60 percent of web interactions begin with a search query, the majority of which utilize Google’s search capabilities. The implications of this unfolding narrative are profound, and the world watches closely as this pivotal moment in tech history unfolds.
