Meta is gearing up to enhance its Ray-Ban smart glasses by introducing a display in a future release, as reported by Financial Times and 9to5Google. This anticipated update is set to debut in the second half of 2025, marking a significant evolution for the popular smart eyewear.

Currently, the Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses primarily rely on audio and phone integration for user notifications and responses from Meta AI. Users have enjoyed seamless interaction through sound, but the addition of a small screen will elevate the user experience by providing visual notifications. This upgrade reflects Meta's ambition to create lightweight, easy-to-wear devices that could one day replace smartphones for day-to-day computing.

However, it's important to note that Meta does not plan to transform the Ray-Ban glasses into a full-fledged mixed-reality device. Instead, the company is concurrently developing its Orion AR glasses, which promise a more advanced augmented reality experience.

Recently, Meta released the latest version (11) of the smart glassesâ€™ software, which introduced features like Live AI and live translation. However, these enhancements are exclusively available to early access participants in the U.S. and Canada.

As Meta continues to innovate within the realm of smart eyewear, the promised display for Ray-Ban glasses signifies a leap forward in making technology more accessible and integrated into everyday life.
