## Honey, the deal-hunting browser extension, faces scrutiny after allegations of misleading customers and influencers with deceptive discount practices and manipulative affiliate commission structures.
In a recent turn of events, Honey, the popular deal-hunting browser extension, finds itself mired in controversy following accusations of deceptive practices that have allegedly cost customers significant savings and deprived influencers of their rightful commissions.

The allegations were prominently brought to light by YouTuber MegaLag, who claimed that Honey manipulates its discount offerings by selectively showcasing smaller savings—like 5%—while larger discounts, such as 30%, go unmentioned. This practice, according to MegaLag, not only misleads customers but also affects creators who rely on transparent affiliate commissions. He asserts that Honey employs a last-click attribution model that reroutes these commissions through its own links, effectively depriving influencers of their earnings when they promote the extension.

Initially, Honey was known for its ability to collect and apply existing discount codes automatically. However, the service has evolved to partner with businesses to offer its own codes, such as “HONEY10” for a mere 10% discount. This pivot has raised concerns that Honey is prioritizing its own discounts over potentially better deals, potentially costing users more in their shopping endeavors.

The fallout from these allegations has reverberated across the influencer community. High-profile creators, including MrBeast, Emma Chamberlain, and Marques Brownlee, may have unwittingly promoted Honey while being deprived of the financial benefits they would have otherwise received. Some influencers, like Markiplier, were suspicious of Honey's business practices and opted out of sponsorships as a result.

As the allegations have gained traction, public backlash has ensued, with users and creators alike voicing their dissatisfaction and demanding greater transparency in marketing practices. Notably, creators such as Linus Tech Tips have severed ties with Honey over the aforementioned issues, underpinning a broader call for ethical standards in influencer marketing.

Despite the gravity of the claims, Honey and its parent company, PayPal, have not issued any public statements addressing the accusations or the ensuing criticism. This silence further fuels concerns about transparency within the company and the wider industry dynamics.

The scandal surrounding Honey underscores a critical need for reform in how influencers and affiliate marketing operate to safeguard both consumers and creators from potential manipulative practices. As the conversation continues, the impact on Honey's reputation and operations remains to be seen.
