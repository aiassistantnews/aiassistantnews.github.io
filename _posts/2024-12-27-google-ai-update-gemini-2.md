## Google has launched Gemini 2.0, revolutionizing its AI capabilities and enhancing search functionalities with improved contextual understanding and source reliability.
In a significant leap forward for artificial intelligence, Google has announced the launch of Gemini 2.0, its most sophisticated AI model to date. Designed to facilitate more complex conceptual work, Gemini 2.0 is poised to handle tasks requiring advanced reasoning and decision-making skills that mimic human thought processes. The model aims to not only understand the world around users but also to anticipate their needs by thinking multiple steps ahead and taking supervised actions on their behalf.

One of the standout improvements in this latest iteration of Google's AI is its ability to enhance search results, particularly by providing users with more useful and contextually aware information. The new model features advanced human-like reasoning capabilities and can adeptly solve complex math problems, including generating computer code.

As part of its continuous evolution, Google is also set to enhance the AI Overviews displayed in its search results. While these overviews currently showcase their sources, the Gemini app has lacked this critical feature, making it challenging for users to determine the reliability of the information. However, recent discoveries in beta code suggest that upcoming updates will address this issue by introducing a **Sources and Related Content** header at the bottom of the Gemini overview page, allowing users to easily access a list of the websites used as sources for the AI-generated content.

Furthermore, Google's Vertex AI continues to expand its repertoire of foundation models, which presently includes Gemini 1.0 Pro Vision and Gemini 1.0 Ultra. Notably, the Gemini 1.0 Pro Vision model has a set discontinuation date of April 9, 2025. 

These enhancements come against the backdrop of increasing competition in the AI space, particularly highlighted by the launch of OpenAIâ€™s SearchGPT. Marketers are now urged to adapt their SEO and content strategies to maintain competitiveness in an increasingly AI-driven search environment. As part of this shift, Google's own Search Generative Experience, recently rebranded as AI overviews, has been refined to offer large sections of AI-generated text designed to address user queries directly, potentially reducing the need for users to click through to specific pages. Overall, the latest updates reflect Google's strategic commitment to remain at the forefront of the evolving landscape of artificial intelligence, catering to users' demands for reliable and accurate information.
