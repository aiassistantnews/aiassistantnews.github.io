## Alibaba announces the release of QVQ-72B, an open-source multimodal AI model that enhances visual and textual reasoning capabilities, achieving impressive benchmarks and offering new opportunities for scientific research and education.
Alibaba's Qwen team has made a significant breakthrough in artificial intelligence with the release of the QVQ-72B, an open-source multimodal AI model designed to seamlessly integrate visual and textual reasoning capabilities. Building upon the foundations laid by the earlier Qwen2-VL-72B model, the QVQ-72B aims to enhance the model's visual reasoning abilities while equipping it with the power of language understanding. 

This experimental research model is geared towards complex reasoning and analytical tasks, particularly excelling in multi-step and mathematical reasoning. Demonstrating its prowess, the QVQ-72B achieved an impressive score of 70.3 in the MMMU (Multimodal Multidisciplinary University) benchmark, which evaluates AI's ability to perform at a university level through combined text and image-based reasoning.

Moreover, the model showcased strong analytical capabilities in mathematical problem-solving, utilizing graphical representations and visual aids. In benchmarks like MathVista and MathVision, its accuracy rivals that of established proprietary systems such as OpenAI's GPT-4, marking a significant milestone for open-source technology. Additionally, its performance in OlympiadBench underscores the model's capability in addressing bilingual problems from international math and physics competitions, further bridging the gap between open and closed-source AI.

Openly available under the Qwen license and hosted on Hugging Face Spaces, developers have the freedom to explore its capabilities in real-time. The model can be deployed locally using various frameworks, including MLX optimized for macOS and Hugging Face Transformers, making it adaptable across different platforms.

Despite its achievements, the QVQ-72B is not without its challenges. Language switching, hallucinations, and recursive reasoning loops remain hurdles that the Qwen team aims to navigate in future developments. Their long-term vision involves creating a unified model that incorporates additional modalities such as audio and beyond, with the goal of approaching artificial general intelligence (AGI).

With its multifaceted potential, the QVQ-72B is particularly beneficial for scientific research and education, where data interpretation across diverse formats is crucial. It also enhances analytical capabilities for professionals dealing with technical reports and chart analysis, paving the way for improved information extraction.

In summary, the QVQ-72B stands as a testament to Alibaba's commitment to advancing multimodal AI. While it showcases impressive performance across various benchmarks, it also highlights the intricacies of developing such technology and underscores the importance of ongoing research to address its limitations.
