A global study has unveiled a stark contrast in attitudes towards embracing in-vehicle AI between Eastern and Western markets, with European drivers particularly reluctant.

The research, conducted by MHP, surveyed 4,700 car drivers across China, the US, Germany, the UK, Italy, Sweden, and Poland, revealing significant geographical disparities in AI acceptance and understanding.

According to the study, while AI is becoming integral to modern vehicles, European consumers remain hesitant about its implementation and value proposition.

Regional disparities
The study found that 48 percent of Chinese respondents view in-car AI predominantly as an opportunity, while merely 23 percent of European respondents share this optimistic outlook. In Europe, 39 percent believe AI's opportunities and risks are broadly balanced, while 24 percent take a negative stance, suggesting the risks outweigh potential benefits.

Understanding of AI technology also varies significantly by region. While over 80 percent of Chinese respondents claim to understand AI's use in cars, this figure drops to just 54 percent among European drivers, highlighting a notable knowledge gap.

Marcus Willand, Partner at MHP and one of the study's authors, notes: "The figures show that the prospect of greater safety and comfort due to AI can motivate purchasing decisions. However, the European respondents in particular are often hesitant and price-sensitive."

The willingness to pay for AI features shows an equally stark divide. Just 23 percent of European drivers expressed willingness to pay for AI functions, compared to 39 percent of Chinese drivers. The study suggests that most users now expect AI features to be standard rather than optional extras.
